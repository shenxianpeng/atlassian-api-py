## Overview

This package is a Python wrapper for the Atlassian REST API, currently supporting JIRA and Bitbucket. It simplifies the implementation of integration with these tools.

ðŸ“˜ Documentation: [atlassian-api-py.readthedocs.io](https://atlassian-api-py.readthedocs.io/)

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
$ pip install atlassian-api-py
```

To upgrade to the latest version, use:

```bash
$ pip install atlassian-api-py --upgrade
```

**Establish connection**

You can connect to JIRA using a username and password or a token.

Using Username and Password

```python
>>> from atlassian import Jira
>>> jira = Jira(url='https://jira.company.com', username="username", password="password")
```

Using a Token

```python
>>> from atlassian import Jira
>>> jira = Jira(url='https://jira.company.com', token="yourToken")
```

Using a Configuration File

Alternatively, you can store your credentials in a `config.ini` file:

```markdown
[jira]
url = https://jira.company.com
username = username
password = password
# Or
token = yourToken
```

Then, you can use the configuration file to establish a connection:

```python
>>> import configparser
>>> config = configparser.ConfigParser()
>>> config.read('config.ini')

>>> jira_url = config['jira']['url']
>>> jira_usr = config['jira']['username']
>>> jira_psw = config['jira']['password']
>>> jira_token = config['jira']['token']
```

### Getting issue fields

Next, you can get the issue's fields as follow:

```python
>>> issue = jira.issue('TEST-1')
>>> print(issue.fields.status.name)
Triage
>>> print(issue.fields.description)
this is a demo jira ticket
>>> print(issue.fields.status.name)
Triage
>>> print(issue.fields.issuetype.name)
Bug
```

### Getting issue more fields

```python
>>> print(issue.id)
1684517
>>> print(issue.key)
TEST-1
>>> print(issue.fields.assignee.key)
xpshen
>>> print(issue.fields.summary)
